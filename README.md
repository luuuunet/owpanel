Open Panel is a **self-hosted**, **decentralized** control plane for your own Linux servers. No vendor lock-in, no central cloud — you run the panel on your machine, your data stays on your machine. Built-in **automation** handles backups, cron jobs, service restarts, log analysis, and AI-assisted ops so you spend less time on repetitive tasks.

### Highlights

- **Decentralized by design** — Single binary on your server; no external account or control plane required
- **Automated operations** — Scheduled backups, cron templates, one-click service control, auto log cleanup
- **Smart dashboard** — Live metrics, health score, traffic map, and running-service overview
- **AI-assisted ops** — Built-in AI for log analysis, SSH terminal help, and site/project workflows
- **Full stack control** — Websites, databases, Docker, firewall/WAF, FTP, mail, DNS from one UI

Built with **Go** + **Vue 3**. Embedded web UI, systemd service, Linux only.

### Dashboard

Real-time health, resource trends, global traffic, and one place to start/stop/restart every installed service.

### Log Center & AI

Centralized logs across panel, system, websites, CDN, and WAF — with **AI analysis** to spot errors and suggest fixes. Auto-refresh, retention policies, and automated cleanup.
